Kafka, Elasticsearch, and PostgreSQL running externally (and maintained separately from the solution), all with SSL enabled.

* PostgreSQL server as the central database for OpenNMS and Grafana.
** For Google Cloud, the solution was tested using Google SQL for PostgreSQL with SSL and a private IP.

* Kafka cluster for OpenNMS-to-Minion communication.

* Elasticsearch cluster for flow persistence.

* Grafana Loki server for log aggregation.
** https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/getting-started/logcli/[logcli] helps extract OpenNMS logs from the command line for troubleshooting purposes.

* https://cloud.google.com/filestore[Google Filestore] or https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/files/[Azure Files] for the OpenNMS configuration and RRD files (managed by provider)
** The documentation recommends 1.21 or later for the CSI driver.
** Only applicable when using dedicated OpenNMS UI instances.

* Private container registry for custom Meridian images (if applicable), if OpenNMS Horizon is not an option.

* https://cert-manager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[cert-manager] to provide HTTPS/TLS support to the web-based services the ingress controller manages.
** A `ClusterIssuer` to use it across multiple independent OpenNMS installations.

* Nginx Ingress Controller, as the solution has not been tested with other Ingress implementations.
