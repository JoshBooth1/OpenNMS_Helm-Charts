=== External Dependencies

Kafka, Elasticsearch, and PostgreSQL to run externally (and maintained separately from the solution), all with SSL enabled.

* PostgreSQL server as the central database for OpenNMS and Grafana.
  * For Google Cloud, the solution was tested using Google SQL for PostgreSQL with SSL and a Private IP.

* Kafka cluster for OpenNMS-to-Minion communication.

* Elasticsearch cluster for flow persistence.

* Grafana Loki server for log aggregation.
  * [logcli](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/getting-started/logcli/) helps extract OpenNMS logs from the command line for troubleshooting purposes.

* [Google Filestore](https://cloud.google.com/filestore) or [Azure Files](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/files/) for the OpenNMS configuration and RRD files (managed by provider)
  * The documentation recommends 1.21 or later for the CSI driver.
  * Only applicable when using dedicated OpenNMS UI instances.

* Private Container Registry for custom Meridian Images (if applicable), in case OpenNMS Horizon is not an option.

* [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to provide HTTPS/TLS support to the web-based services managed by the ingress controller.
  * A `ClusterIssuer` is required to use it across multiple independent OpenNMS installations.

* Nginx Ingress Controller, as the solution has not been tested with other Ingress implementaions.
