= About OpenNMS Helm Charts

OpenNMS Helm Charts makes it easier for users to run OpenNMS Horizon or Meridian in a Kubernetes cluster.

Each deployment through OpenNMS Helm Charts has a single Core server, multiple read-only UI servers, Grafana and a custom Ingress that shares the RRD files and some configuration files, and Sentinels for flow processing.

_How many Sentinels?_

Note that this is one way to approach the solution.
We recommend that you study the content of the Helm chart and tune it for your needs.
